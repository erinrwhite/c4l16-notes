Design ethics: it's a thing

 - systems design influences user behavior
 	- persuasive design, dark patterns, smart defaults
 	- design persuades whether you intend it to or not!
 	- implement constraints to user's benefit
 	- design recognizable affordances
 - systems design reflects designer's values and cultural context
 	- seek out/recognize your biases
 	- diversify your practices
 	- undersand your culture and its mores
 - 80/20 rule: the system's interests will conflict with users' interests
 	- recognize and acknowledge your compromises
 	- know your users
 	- design with empathy
